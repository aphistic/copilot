copilot
=======

copilot is an application designed to be used with a Raspberry Pi and touch screen
to copy files to an external USB device.  This project was originally started to allow
my parents (who are big fans of Geocaching) to copy files to their Geocaching-enabled
GPS that had a limited memory capacity from a small device, removing the need to
carry a laptop with them.  The hardware costs around $100 so it's pretty relatively
cheap.

The hardware it's been run on is the following (Adafruit is awesome, btw!):

* Raspberry Pi 2 (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2358)
* PiTFT Plus Touchscreen (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2441)
* PiTFT Pibow+ (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2779)

Intended Usage
--------------
copilot is designed to be a repository of files where you use a web interface (built
into copilot) to upload files before traveling and then using the touchscreen while
on the road to copy files to/delete files from an external USB drive (whether it's a GPS
or another USB drive).

Maturity
--------
copilot is a new project so there will be some bugs! Don't blame me if it deletes
all your files! :)  It shouldn't but this is your warning.
